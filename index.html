                <p>
                    My name is Lara DeStein and I am a student at Vanderbilt Universty's Coding Bootcamp, seeking a career in full-stack web development.
                    I graduated from the Universtiy of California Davis with a BA in Psychology in 2017. I began working for East Bay Innovations, a
                    non-profit organization whose mission is to empower individuals with disabilities to live in their own homes, work in jobs of their 
                    choosing, and be a part of their community. After working at EBI as a Direct Support Professional, Executive Administrative Assistnat, 
                    and Billing Manager, I reflected upon what skills I could develop to continue growing professionally. As a billing manager, I realized some 
                    needs that could be met if we incorporated new databases we could serve more clients and simplify processes. I hope to use the skills I 
                    acquire through Vanderbilt University's Coding Bootcamp to build websites, databases, and apps for agencies whose mission is helping others.
